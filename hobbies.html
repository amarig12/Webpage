    <h2>Jet Skiing</h2>
    <div class="jetski">
        <p>My first hobby that I would like to talk about is Jet Skiing. I usually jet ski almost every week and we usually ride to the various bays down the islands. Often times we tie up to boats and go on the boats and party/lime.</p>

    <h2>Hiking</h2>
    <p>My second hobby is hiking. I like to hike with my friends to different waterfalls/springs to lime and swim around.</p>
